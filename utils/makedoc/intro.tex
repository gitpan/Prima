\chapter{Introduction}

\subsubsection{Preface}

Prima is an extensible Perl toolkit for multi-platform GUI development.
Platforms supported include Linux, Windows NT/9x/2K, and UNIX/X11 
workstations (FreeBSD, IRIX, SunOS, Solaris and others).
The toolkit contains a rich set of standard widgets and has emphasis on 2D 
image processing tasks. A Perl program using PRIMA looks and behaves identically 
on X11 and Win32.

The Prima project was started in 1997 in Protein Laboratory, Copenhagen,
by Anton Berezin, Dmitry Karasik, and Vadim Belman.

This document describes programming with Prima graphic toolkit, and is a
collection of manual pages of Prima application program interface ( API ),
written by D.Karasik, except Prima::IniFile and Prima::ScrollBar, written
by A.Berezin.

\subsubsection{Requirements}

Prima supports perl versions 5.004 and above. The recommended perl 
versions are 5.005 and above. In UNIX(tm) environments, Prima can use 
the following graphic libraries: libjpeg, libungif, libtiff, libpng, libXpm.

\subsubsection{Installation}

The toolkit can be downloaded from \texttt{http://www.prima.eu.org} in
