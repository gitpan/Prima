
PRIMA is a general purpose extensible graphical user interface 
toolkit with a rich set of standard widgets and an emphasis on 
2D image processing tasks. A Perl program using PRIMA looks 
and behaves identically on X, Win32 and OS/2 PM. 

BINARY DISTRIBUTION INSTALLATION
================================

Copy all files to the perl distribution with the hierarchy 
structure preserved. You have to patch Prima::Config.pm 
manually if you need to compile prima-dependent modules.


EXAMPLES
========

Look at the code located in examples subdirectory.
Typical code starts with

   use Prima qw(Application);

and ends with
   
   run Prima;

which is an event loop call. Try to begin from the followind code:

   use Prima qw(Application Buttons);

   Prima::Window-> create(
      text     => 'Hello world!',
      size     => [ 200, 200],
   )-> insert( Button =>
      centered => 1,
      text     => 'Hello world!',
      onClick  => sub { $::application-> close },
   );

   run Prima;
