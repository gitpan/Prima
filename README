DESCRIPTION
===========

PRIMA is a general purpose extensible graphical user interface 
toolkit with a rich set of standard widgets and an emphasis on 
2D image processing tasks. A Perl program using PRIMA looks 
and behaves identically on X, Win32 and OS/2 PM. 

SOURCE DISTRIBUTION INSTALLATION
================================

Create a makefile by running Makefile.PL using perl
and then run make ( or gmake, or nmake for Win32 and OS/2):

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If 'perl Makefile.PL' fails, the compilation history along with errors 
can be found in makefile.log. 

If make fails with message

** No image codecs found

that means you don't have image libraries that Prima supports in your path.
Prima supports libungif, libjpeg, libpng and gbm - latter is compiled customly
and named libprigraph. For win32 users it is recommended to
download http://www.prima.eu.org/download/gbm-bin-win32.zip. 
The zip file is to be unpacked and prigraph.dll and zlib.dll to be put 
in the same directory as Prima.dll ( which appears 
after successful compilation in auto/Prima subdirectory ), and 
prigraph.lib should be put into LIBPATH. For OS/2 system 
download http://www.prima.eu.org/download/gbm-bin-os2.zip.
The zip file is to be unpacked and prigraph.dll and priz.dll to be put 
into PATH, and prigraph.lib should be put into LIBPATH. 

If some of the required libraries or include files can not
be found, INCPATH+=/some/include and LIBPATH+=/some/lib semantics
should be used to tell Makefile.PL about these.

To install into a private library, for example your home
directory:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=$HOME/lib/perl

If compilation process fails because Makefile contains
invalid switches for your compiler or linker, try changing
these by specifying arguments to Makefile.PL, where the most useful are:

   COMPILER - type of compiler ( gcc, emx, mscv32, bcc32, irixcc)
   CC       - compiler command
   CFLAGS   - compiler arguments
   LD       - linked command
   LDFLAGS  - linker arguments

Look in Makefile.PL for details.

BINARY DISTRIBUTION INSTALLATION
================================

Available only for MSWin32 and OS/2. Please use
installation from source for the other platforms.

To install the toolkit from the binary distribution 
run 

   perl ms_install.pl

You have to patch Prima::Config.pm 
manually if you need to compile prima-dependent modules.

EXAMPLES
========

Look at the code located in examples subdirectory.
Typical code starts with

   use Prima qw(Application);

and ends with
   
   run Prima;

which is an event loop call. Try to begin from the followind code:

   use Prima qw(Application Buttons);

   Prima::Window-> create(
      text     => 'Hello world!',
      size     => [ 200, 200],
   )-> insert( Button =>
      centered => 1,
      text     => 'Hello world!',
      onClick  => sub { $::application-> close },
   );

   run Prima;

Or, alternatively, start the VB program, which is
the toolkit visual builder. All examples and
programs included into the distribution can be run
either by their name or with perl as argument - for 
example, ..../generic or perl ..../generic . 
( perl ..../generic.bat for win32 )

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visit http://www.prima.eu.org/ for the recent versions
of the toolkit. You can use cvs update feature to keep
in touch. The mailing list on the toolkit is avialable,
you can ask questions there. See the Prima homepage for
details.
